For the architecture used in this assigment, Alice is represented using the number 1, Bob is number 2, and the KDC is number 3.
There are 2 different directories with files:
    Needham_Schroeder_Reflection_Attack
    Extended_Needham_Schroeder

The first contains the implemnetation of the reflection attack implementation.
The second contains the extended Needham Schroeder implementation that doesn't allow for reflection attacks.

Used the library pycrypto (https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/) to help with the 3DES implementation.
