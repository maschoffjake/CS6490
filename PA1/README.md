There are 2 different directories with files:
    Needham_Schroeder_Reflection_Attack
    Expanded_Needham_Schroeder

The first contains the implemnetation of the reflection attack implementation.
The second contains the expanded Needham Schroeder implementation that doesn't allow for reflection attacks.

Used the library pycrypto (https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/) to help with the 3DES implementation.
